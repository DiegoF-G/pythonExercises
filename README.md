# pythonExercises
Only my python training, my playground. From a python course of [Curso em Video](https://www.cursoemvideo.com/curso/python-3-mundo-3/).
In this repository, contains python files (and a package with modules and anothers packages) of each exercise that I did. 
I used the Pycharm IDE to program the contents of these files.
I will also add extra files beyond Curso em Video files.
